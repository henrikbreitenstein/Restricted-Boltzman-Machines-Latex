\section{Noisy intermediate-scale Quantum}

The state of modern day quantum computers are in the so called 'noisy intermediate-scale quantum', meaning that the computers are not quite so accurate and with relatively few qubits. Taking into account, and minimizing, noise in our output is relevant when using real world quantum computers, opposed to simulated ones.
