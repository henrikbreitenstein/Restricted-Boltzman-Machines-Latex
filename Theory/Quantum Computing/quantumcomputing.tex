Quantum computing is to process quantum information by applying operations to it. As opposed to classical computers, quantum computers can make use of quantum phenomena, such as entanglement and superposition, to expedite calculations in some cases. To understand how to process information through a quantum computer it is essential to understand the mathematics of quantum computing.
