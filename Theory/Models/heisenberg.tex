\section{The Heisenberg model}

The Heisenberg model is similar to the Ising model, only with a slight variation. Instead of considering nearest neighbors in both directions, the dipoles interact only in one direction. The local energy of a configuration is defined

\begin{equation}
  H(\boldsymbol{\sigma}) =J\sum_{i}\sigma_i\sigma_{i+1}+h\displaystyle\sum_{i}\sigma_i \; ,
  \label{eq:Heisenberg_hamiltonian}
\end{equation}

where we have the coupling constant $J$ and single particle energy $h$.
