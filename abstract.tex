We implement a restricted Boltzmann machine that approximate the ground state energy of a Hamiltonian matrix. For the Lipkin model we see the accuracy of the RBM change drastically with the addition of pair excitation. The Ising model has the RBM managed the better approximate in general, though we find it diverging at low interaction strengths. The Heisenberg model ground state energy was shown to be accurately predicted overall, while for the Pairing model we find the RBM unable to take pair excitation into account. With diagonalization algorithm for sparse matrices we found indication that our RBM impementation is faster at higher system sizes. Lastly we compared the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with and without acceptance criteria and found the criteria method to be slightly better at the cost of a large increase in computation time.
